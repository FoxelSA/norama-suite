## norama-suite<br />Panorama tools suite

This software suite offers tools for numerical panoramas manipulation. Mainly based on equirectangular mapping, the norama-suite tools are each designed to solve a single task on panoramas, in order to maintain a good modularity of the suite. A typical example is given by rectilinear mapping extraction from a entire equirectangular mapped image.
