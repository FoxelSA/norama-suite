## norama-suite<br />Panorama tools suite

<p align="justify">
This software suite offers tools for numerical panoramas manipulation. Mostly designed for equirectangular mappings, its role is to provide an interface to <i>libgnomonic</i> and its algorithms. It then offers an interface to projection and transformation features implemented in the gnomonic library. The <i>norama-suite</i> is also interfaced with <i>libcsps</i> in order to take advantage of camera motion tracking to operate and align panoramas on earth. It also comes with a panorama viewer to complete the suite.
